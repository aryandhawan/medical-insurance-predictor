Medical Insurance Cost Prediction: Model Training & Comparison
About the Project
This repository contains scripts and modules for training, evaluating, and comparing multiple machine learning models to predict medical insurance costs. The goal is to identify the best-performing model for deployment in a Flask-based web application.

## Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and encoding categorical variables.

Model Training: Implementation and comparison of various models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Model Evaluation: Metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² scores.

Cross-Validation: Use of cross-validation techniques for robust model evaluation.

## Dependencies
Python 3.11

pandas

numpy

scikit-learn		

## Roadmap

 Data exploration and preprocessing

 Model training and evaluation

 Model comparison
